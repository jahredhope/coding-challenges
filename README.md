# Hackerrank Challenges and coding examples

Hackerrank is a fun website where you can do little coding challenges.
I highly recommend it.

## Sudoku Solver
Solve a Sudoku puzzle

This went through a couple of iterations. The latest one will solve most sudoku problems but certainly could do with a little bit of smarts added in

## Matrix Rotation
Take a (potentially massive) matrix and rotate each value around.

I was really happy with my idea of using maths to calculate what quadrant I was in... till I realized the matrix could rotate a ton of times. Still works but having to work out what ring (and therefore perimeter length) each element is in kind of defeats the purpose of the quadrants.

## Quickest Way Up
Find the best possible game of board game with down and up connections.

Still haven't really solved this graph theory style. My solution is a bit bruit forcy, but it works for the size of the problems given.
